# Forest_Cover_Classification_ML
This project focuses on classifying forest cover types using machine learning models based on features like elevation, soil type, and hydrology. The pipeline includes data preprocessing, EDA, feature selection, and model training (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost). Tools like Scikit-learn and Matplotlib are used to visualize and evaluate performance
